This mod functions similarly to Xaero's Minimap Mod for Minecraft.
All* npcs, enemies, items, projectiles, critters, etc. will show on the fullscreen and minimap,
There are multiple configurable options, to better suit your needs.

*Some npcs such as minibosses, town npcs, bosses, and various small obscure things such as windy balloons (windy day slimes) will not render.

Please note that this is still in development. I do plan on improving code, as well as performance and features.

If you want to add custom icons for specific npcs, all you need to do is add to a Dictionary located inside the Dictionaries class.
The draw code will first check for a dictionary entry, if none is found, then it manually draws the npc on the map.
This is useful if certain enemies / bosses are drawing incorrectly, or if you want them to just have a nice map icon.
